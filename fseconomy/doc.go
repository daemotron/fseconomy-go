# Configuring Credentials

You will require FSEconomy API keys when using the FSEconomy SDK:

* A Service Key is required to use the REST API
* A combination of User Key and Access Key is required to use the data feeds
* Alternatively, the data feeds can also be used with a Service Key instead of a User Key
